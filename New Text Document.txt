Missing Product_About_Item cut off
Product Tree needs rework missing items.
When selecting items the selection list once closed and selected again it looses previous selection
For example make 3 selections, close screen then open screen again and select 4th item and close it 	it will be lost
Needs to preserve these setings 	

Leafes need to be having config depth scan
Needs to be have separate process or screen that kicks off to rebuild product tree and saves it to DB probably
