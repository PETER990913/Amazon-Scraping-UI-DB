Frequently questions and trouble shooting regarding the ring stand.
Q: Why does the ring won’t stay at any angle I want?
A: The tension of the hinge was technically limited by the slim design, so it will not tight enough for any angle, but enough for most use cases, please follow the above guide for better experience.
Q: How to reposition the stand for portrait mode or landscape mode?
A: Method 1, flip up the outer ring then rotate it to the right mode.
Method 2, remove the ring grip then re-attach at the right mode.
Frequently questions and trouble shooting regarding wireless charging compatibility.
Q: Why does wireless charging not work with the grip stay on?
A: 1). Thickness is really matters to wireless charging, since the grip added extra thickness to the back of the phone, therefore a thin magnet case was required for wirelessly top up.
Please make sure to use a case with less than 1.5mm thickness.
Through our tests, most of products including OtterBox Symmetry Mag series and official Mag case would work well.
2). While you confirm that phone case is not the reason, please make sure that you are using a magnetic wireless charger with a 20W or more (which deliveries 9V-2.22A rating)output wall adapter.
Q: Why does it so slow when wireless charging？
A: We’ve tested that it will take 2-3 hours to fully charge an iPhone 13/12 via Mag charger with the New MagOne stay on (It is slower than charge with the grip removed since the extra thickness of the grip would cause losses of efficiency).
On the other hand, wireless charging output was usually limited (even stopped) when temperature gets high, which means the environment temperature matters, therefore, if you need it faster, please remove the New MagOne before using wireless charging, or charge your phone via cord charger.
Upgraded Hinge
This new stronger, tighter, tiny hinge also optimized the limited times of flipping out/in from 1000 times to 3000 times, and it will only lose 20% of tightness after that.
This was the most tough part during our development. But lucky we made it.
Ultra Slim
It is not a tough thing to make a wireless charger compatible phone grip, but things getting much harder if we put magnets in.
Therefore the New MagOne was built-in a group of N52 magnets to get highest performance.
Ultra Finger-Friendly
Considering the slim and extremely limited space of the product, there isn't much choice except silicone to do the strap job.
In order to meet comfortability and durability, the strap is made of liquid silicone which is more durable than normal silicone. The coated finger-friendly material makes it so smooth for slip-in.
Important Reminders:
Not compatible with non-magnetic phone cases, it will cause a weak connection.
Do not forcefully swing your phone with the ring holder on as the company will not responsible for damage from misuse of products, including but not limited to falls or intense movement.
You don't need to remove the grip when wireless charging, but please make sure: a. Use a magnetic case which thickness no more than 1.5mm (while most of existing products works good through our test, please make sure this when you need the feature work properly.) b. Use a magnetic wireless charger but not normal desktop wireless charging pad. We've tested that most of existing magnetic wireless charger will work well, but if the charger power is too weak, you may need to remove the grip before charging, therefore, a minimum of 20W wall adapter is required.
We covered a silicone loop pad on the back side of the phone grip, but it still may scratch the back of your phone case. Thus we prepared a film case-back protector to avoid this issue, make sure to stick the film on.
Please follow the guide to properly remove the ring grip from your phone, incorrect methods may cause damage of the silicone strap.
